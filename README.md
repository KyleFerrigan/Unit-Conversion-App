#Multi-Convert A SwiftUI Converter App

Made by Kyle Ferrigan

I made this as I wanted a simple, ad-free, lightweight unit conversion app. My specific problem started with Ohms-Law, but I expanded the scope from there as I learned how to code in SwiftUI.

In Progress: Better Mac Catalyst support, Better iPadOS scaling.
